# Dealership Management System

## Description of the Project

The Dealership Management System is a Java-based console application designed to manage vehicle inventory, lease contracts, and sales contracts for a car dealership. The system allows users to search for vehicles based on various filters (such as make, model, year, and price), add and remove vehicles from the inventory, and manage lease and sales contracts. It aims to simplify the process of managing vehicle sales and leases, ensuring that the dealership runs efficiently.
